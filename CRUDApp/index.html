    <h1>Mr Meeseeks Adventure!</h1>

                <h2>Mr Meeseeks' are creatures created to serve a singular purpose. Once they have served this purpose
                    they expire/vanish.</h2>

                <p>You can summon a <strong>Mr Meeseeks</strong> by activating a <strong>Mr Meeseeks box.</strong> This
                    allows you to name him and <strong>assign him a task</strong> you want him to complete, recording
                    also the date that the task was assigned. Mark the task as completed once Mr Meeseeks has fulfilled
                    his purpose by clicking the "expire" button and he will then disappear!</p>

                <p>Although dedicated to the task initially assigned to him, Mr Meeseeks can be persuaded to
                    <strong>shift his purpose</strong>- you can then ask him to complete a different task of your
                    choosing. To do this, select the "edit" button.</p>

                <p>You can view all the tasks you have assigned to Mr Meeseeks' on the App page.</p>
